This is project for designing a scaffolding tool with miBF usage. The algorithm imitates LINKS as much as it can.

Submodules:
  * btllib
  * btl_bloomfilter
Dependent subdirectory:
  * Common

After cloning directly from the repository run:
```bash
./autogen.sh
```
Compiling BioBloomTools should be as easy as:
```bash
./configure && make
```
